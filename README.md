Develop 2 applications:
        App 1:
            Have the user enter the following information:
                      ProductName
                      ProductIDNumber
                      ProductInventoryCount
                      ProductDescription
              Have a button that will send the above info to App2 using a broadcast reciever
              Restrict broadcast so only the two apps can use that broadcast
            App2:
                Have a database that will hold the info sent from app1 and display all the info in a recyclerView.  
                If the device is a tablet, show the description else do not show the description.
                If the device is a tablet, use font size 28sp for the Name, else use 18sp
